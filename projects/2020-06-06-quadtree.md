I did this project for [UBC's CPSC 221 course](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=CPSC&course=221).

Implemented an image compression technique written in C++, such that the output image has reduced color detail in areas that do not contain much color variability in the original image, but maintains detail in areas containing lots of variability in the original image.
Represented an image as a self-balancing quadtree, each of its nodes consisted of a group of pixels. Implemented recursive algorithms to split the node with the highest color variance among its pixels into children nodes, such that the splits maintained the height balance of the quadtree by possibly incurring neighboring splits.
